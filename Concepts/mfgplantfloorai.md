## System

### Define the Key Components of the Generative AI System

Before designing the process, break down your AI application into its main components:

- Input Layer – How the application collects user input (text, images, voice, etc.).
- AI Model Layer – The Large Language Model (LLM) or Generative AI engine (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA, Gemini).
- Processing & Fine-Tuning Layer – How the system processes inputs, retrieves knowledge, and generates responses.
- User Interface (UI/UX) Layer – Web, mobile, or chatbot interface for interacting with users.
- Data & Feedback Loop – How the system learns and improves over time.

### Create the System Process Flow

A system process flow diagram helps explain how data flows through the application. Here’s an example of a Generative AI system process for an AI-powered Manufacturing Assistant:

- Step 1: User Input (Data Collection)
🔹 User Query/Input: The user interacts with the AI via a web app, chatbot, or voice assistant.
🔹 Input Types: Text-based prompts, images (for vision-based AI), or voice commands.
🔹 Preprocessing: The system cleans, normalizes, and structures input before processing.

- Tech Stack: FastAPI/Flask (backend), React/Vue (frontend), OpenAI Whisper (for voice input).

- Step 2: AI Processing & Model Execution
🔹 The system routes input to the AI engine (LLM like GPT-4, LLaMA, or custom fine-tuned model).
🔹 If retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is used, the system fetches relevant data from a knowledge base.
🔹 AI generates contextual responses based on real-time data, historical knowledge, or predefined templates.

- Tech Stack: OpenAI API, LangChain, Pinecone/Weaviate (vector database for RAG), PyTorch/TensorFlow (for custom models).

- Step 3: AI Response Generation & Post-Processing
🔹 AI generates a response and ensures it aligns with user expectations (via filtering, summarization, or reinforcement).
🔹 The response may include text, images, or interactive elements (charts, action buttons, etc.).
🔹 If needed, the system validates output for safety, compliance, and accuracy.

- Tech Stack: Guardrails AI (for response validation), LangChain (for structured response formatting).

- Step 4: User Interface & Interaction
🔹 The response is displayed in a web dashboard, mobile app, or chatbot.
🔹 Users can provide feedback (thumbs-up/down, comments) to improve AI accuracy.
🔹 If multimodal AI is used, results may be provided in charts, reports, images, or documents.

- Tech Stack: React/Next.js (for UI), TailwindCSS (for styling), Streamlit/Gradio (for quick prototyping).

- Step 5: Feedback Loop & Model Improvement
🔹 User feedback is stored for model retraining & fine-tuning.
🔹 Logs are analyzed for bias, performance issues, or incorrect responses.
🔹 AI continues learning through continuous training and reinforcement.

- Tech Stack: MLflow (for tracking experiments), Azure/AWS pipelines (for model updates).
