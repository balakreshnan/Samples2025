# The AI First Digital Employee Team: Transforming Pre-Sales Engagement (Humans and AI)

## Introduction

I envisioned a new way to handle pre-sales engagement within the professional services industry—a shift utilizing a multi-agent concept where humans and agents collaborate to manage the entire end-to-end process. This concept, which I built within the Azure AI foundry, uses a system of what I call "connected agents," my own personal digital employees.

## Concept

To test this model, I ran a query, asking the system to brainstorm and "create an email agent to prioritize them," intending to understand what had been done and what new avenues we could explore.

Historically, this complex pre-sales work required a human team of five, six, or even up to nine people. Now, my digital team performs the exact same tasks. Each individual agent is given a specific task to do, bringing back specialized information to the collective.

### The Specialist Agents at Work

My digital team includes various personas, each executing a crucial step in the pre-sales workflow:

1. The Resource Planner immediately started identifying the resources that might be required for the engagement.
2. The Business Analyst delved into the "business related things," calculating the market opportunity (including size and growth), identifying target customer segments, and formulating the revenue models and pricing strategy.
3. The Strategic Analyst ensured the application was on the right track by conducting deep dives, such as SWOT analysis and PESTLE analysis.
4. The Ideation Catalyst was tasked with taking the initial idea and proposing new features and approaches, focusing on integrating agentic and LLM type conversational UI with natural language infusion.
5. The Inquiry Specialist operated with its own persona to ask all the pertinent questions, specifically checking the criteria that needed satisfaction and addressing potential privacy concerns.
6. The Technology Advisor researched the technology space, suggesting new components and useful technologies.
7. The Technical Architect focused on creation, specifically generating a Mermaid diagram using cloud PaaS components to ensure the solution could scale as needed.
8. Finally, the Success Metric agent established the necessary KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) tailored to the particular use case, ensuring the application’s success is trackable.

### Collaboration and Output

Once all the digital agents complete their work, they return the data, which is presented to me in a summarized version within a chat thread. This allows for an iterative process where I can ask follow-up questions and keep the conversation going.
I can monitor the efficiency of these iterations by viewing the number of interactions and the total token usage count, confirming that the agents are using the Chat Completion APIs to perform complex iterations, not simple request-response tasks.
The system generates valuable, actionable artifacts. For instance, the flow generated by the Technical Architect, the Mermaid chart, can be taken and input into an online chart tool to visualize how interactions will work between different Azure components. This rigorous approach ensures the entire design adheres to a "cloud scale and cloud first and security first AI first design" philosophy.
Before finalizing the pre-sales output, I can collect specific pieces of information—such as the pricing strategy or market opportunity—and save them to create the comprehensive final document. Furthermore, the entire system is designed for maximum accessibility: it is voice enabled, accepting both voice input and providing voice output.
This is more than just automation; it is the concept of a digital team designed to transform professional services for the next generation

## Conclusion

The future of Professional Services is going to change dramatically with the help of AI and multi-agent systems. By leveraging connected agents, businesses can streamline complex processes, enhance collaboration, and deliver high-quality outcomes efficiently. This approach not only reduces the need for large human teams but also opens up new possibilities for innovation and agility in service delivery. As we continue to explore and refine these technologies, the potential for transforming professional services is immense, promising a future where digital employees work alongside humans to achieve unprecedented levels of productivity and creativity.
