# UW Milwaukee Connected Systems Institute - Simulation and Compsabl modelling

## Introduction

- Building a system to optimize production in a line
- Based on orders, liquids avaiable in a tank
- There are 4 tanks with 4 different colors
- Each tank can do 100 vials
- We can only create 10 orders at a time
- Each batch can only do 30 vials, and then we need to restart the orders.
- This is educational factory line.
- Engineering has limits within it's materials used and their propertiese and knowledge of person's engineering.
- Operations are constrained to what is been engineered.
- So the idea here is understand what would be the best configuration for the system to operate efficiently within these constraints.
- Optimize the work to get the most maximum throughput.

## Steps

- Make sure you have the csv file with sensors and action data.
- Now log into: https://app.composabl.com/auth/sign-in
- Go to Simulators
- Then select New simulators

- Select upload csv file

- Follow the screen for configuration, select which ones are sensors and actions
- Then finalize and submit the simulation
- Go to Dashboard and simulators and should see the new simulator with status.

- Wait for simulation to complete.
