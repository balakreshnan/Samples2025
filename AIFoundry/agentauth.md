# Agentic AI Agent User Authorization - Which user can access which agent

## Introduction

- Create a single repository for all agentic AI agents.
- Enable categorization of agents by type and purpose.
- Create User Authorization for agents to ensure secure access and usage.
- Ability to know which user has access to which agent.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest).
- Audit logging to track user activities and agent usage.
- Integration with existing authentication systems (e.g., OAuth, LDAP).
- User-friendly interface for managing user permissions and roles.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## Concept

- Create a system that we can add agents to a repository.
- Configure the agents with purpose, type, and other metadata.
- COnfigure business unit (BU) and other organizational structures.
- Configure Instruction and prompts for agents.
- Create user roles and permissions.
- Assign users to roles.
- Assign agents to business units.
- Provide a agents certification to authorize usage.
- Provide Owner information for each agent.
- Provide a user interface to manage agents, users, roles, and permissions.
- Provide audit logs to track user activities and agent usage.
- Integrate with agentic applications to enforce user authorization.
